## Phase 15 Detail: Update & Expand Tests

### Fixes

- Fixed integration test imports (`master_place_index_rust_crate` -> `master_place_index`)
- Fixed Cargo.toml description (Patient -> Place) and keywords
- Fixed observability doc file extension (`.dm` -> `.md`)
- Fixed technology doc typos (Observeability, Steraming, Utilties)
- Fixed clippy warning (vec! -> array literal in batch test)

### New Integration Tests

- **integration_models.rs** (16 tests): Full construction/serialization, soft delete timestamps, unique IDs, place hierarchy, geo distance symmetry/triangle inequality, multiple identifier types, consent lifecycle, all place types, full week opening hours, address default/equality
- **integration_scoring.rs** (24 tests): Unicode names, long names, single char, reversed words, address edge cases, geo poles/date line/radius boundary, identifier edge cases, Soundex consistency, custom weights, confidence boundaries, score range validation, phonetic bonus, all components, batch sorting
- **integration_edge_cases.rs** (13 tests): Boundary coordinates, GLN validation, URL protocols, address edge cases, normalization edge cases, all sensitive fields masking, GDPR field preservation, combined pipeline workflows, GLN deterministic override

### New Benchmarks

- **privacy_bench.rs** (4 benchmarks): mask_place, mask_place_minimal, gdpr_export, gdpr_export_batch_100

### Test Totals

- Unit Tests: 104
- Integration Tests: 67
- Benchmark Tests: 16 (Criterion)
- Total: 171 tests + 16 benchmarks

### Documentation Updates

- Updated AGENTS/testing.md with accurate counts
- Updated AGENTS/index.md with complete file listing
- Updated AGENTS/share/technology.md with fixes and descriptions
- Updated AGENTS/share/observability.md (renamed from .dm)
- Updated plan.md, tasks.md, index.md

## Phase 14 Detail: Core Library & Tests

### Domain Models (32 unit tests)
- Place (schema.org/Place based, soft delete, serialization)
- PostalAddress (5 optional fields)
- GeoCoordinates (Haversine distance calculation)
- PlaceType (12 variants + Other)
- PlaceIdentifier (GLN, FIPS, GNIS, OSM, custom)
- AmenityFeature, OpeningHoursSpecification, Consent

### Matching Algorithms (45 unit tests)
- Name matching: Jaro-Winkler similarity, case-insensitive
- Address matching: Weighted field comparison (postal 30%, locality 25%, street 25%, region 10%, country 10%)
- Geo matching: Haversine-based similarity with configurable reference distance
- Identifier matching: Exact type+value match, GLN deterministic override
- Phonetic matching: Soundex algorithm
- Scoring: Weighted aggregation (name 35%, geo 25%, address 20%, type 10%, ID 10%), phonetic bonus, confidence levels (Certain/Probable/Possible/Unlikely)

### Validation (19 unit tests)
- Required name validation
- Coordinate range validation (-90/90, -180/180)
- GLN format validation (13 digits)
- URL format validation (http/https)
- Telephone format validation (international +)
- Address completeness validation
- Address normalization (title-case locality, uppercase region/country)

### Privacy (8 unit tests)
- Phone/fax number masking
- Geo coordinate rounding (2 decimal places)
- GDPR data export (full JSON)
